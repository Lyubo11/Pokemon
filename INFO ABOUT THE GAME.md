Pokemon Project

This is a copy of the classic Pokemon games. The player is a Pokémon trainer and participates in battles from which he wins various prizes or Pokémons. A game has five battles. The user initially chooses three Pokemons (out of 5 possible) and enters a tournament. There are five rounds, each round you battle 1 Pokemon. Each Pokemon has stats and attacks. The battle is turn based, the user chooses which attack to use or switch his pokemon if he wants to.

Project must haves:
 - It doesn't need to have a GUI.
 - Each pokemon has life points, attack points and defense points. It also has a name, appearance, type, size (small, normal, large).
 - All Pokemons have default health, attack and defense points, but if they are small or large, the points are reduced or increased by up to 20% accordingly.
 - The battle takes turns as the opponent's Pokemon attacks first. How many life points it will take from an attack depends on: which one is used, the defense points of  your pokemon, the other's attack, the type of pokemon.
 - The battle continues until the other person's Pokemon dies or until all of your Pokemons die.
 - When you win, you get crystals. These are your final tournament scores, but can also be used to restore your Pokemon's health.
 - If you lose, you lose the game.
